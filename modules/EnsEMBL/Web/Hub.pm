package EnsEMBL::Web::Hub;

### NAME: EnsEMBL::Web::Hub
### A centralised object giving access to data connections and the web environment

### DESCRIPTION:
### Hub uses the Flyweight design pattern to create a single object that is
### passed around between all other objects that require data connectivity.
### The Hub stores information about the current web page and its environment,
### including cgi parameters, settings parsed from the URL, browser session,
### database connections, and so on.
