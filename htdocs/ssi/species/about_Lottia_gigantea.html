  From Ensembl: <i>Lottia gigantea</i>, the owl limpet, is a sea snail (class
  Gastropoda) that is found along rocky inter-tidal regions of the Californian
  coast. Mature limpets are territorial, often returning to the same location on
  the rock (the "home scar"), to which the shape of the shell becomes extremely
  well-fitted. Underlying this territoriality is the cultivation of an algal
  film, across an area proportional to the size of the limpet. Owl limpets
  defend their "gardens" against intruding owl limpets and other species, using
  a range of tactics including brute force shoving and pinching the intruder's
  soft-body between shell and rock [1].

  <i>L. gigantea</i> has many characteristics that are representative of
  molluscs and, more generally, lophotrochozoans, and its genome was sequenced
  alongside two annelids (<i>Capitella teleta</i> and <i>Helobdella robusta</i>)
  to provide insight into metazoan evolution [2]. The genomic data also promotes
  the use of this species as a model organism for studies of evolutionary
  development, ecology, and conservation.

<p>Genome assembly imported from Ensembl.</p>
<p>
  From Ensembl: The <i>Lottia gigantea</i> genome (v1.0, July 2007) was
  sequenced to 8.9x coverage, and assembled with the
  <a href="http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Lotgi1/Lotgi1.info.html">JGI</a> software,
  Jazz. After quality control, the paired-end reads assembled into 4,469
  scaffolds, giving a genome size of approximately 360 Mb.
