  <p>From NCBI: The <i>Crassostrea virginica</i>, or eastern oyster, is a filter-feeding bivalve mollusc. It is a marine animal and consumes phytoplankton. This species is abundant on the east coast of America, and is of commercial value.</p>

  <p>From NCBI: We have sequenced the genome of the Eastern oyster using DNA from a gynogenetic oyster of an inbred line produced at the Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory, Rutgers University, known as sample RU13XGHG1-28 from either a single tissue or pooled extracts from two tissues (mantle, adductor muscle). Sequences were generated on the Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (P6/C4 chemistry) to approx. 74x genome coverage based on a genome size estimate of 675 Mb. All reads were assembled with the FALCON algorithm then error corrected using the Quiver and Pilon algorithms. Scaffolds were generated with the SSPACE-LongRead software. We determined the initial draft assembly contained a high number of single copy gene counts suggesting assembly of heterozygous loci. To ensure proper gene annotation we attempted to generate a mostly haploid representation of the draft assembly using transcript mapping to the draft assembly. All contigs were retained in the C_virginica-3.0 assembly that had single best hits to transcripts.</p>
