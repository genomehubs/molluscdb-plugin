  <p>From publication [1]: The genetic material used for sequencing the genome of the hermaphroditic freshwater snail <i>Biomphalaria glabrata</i> was derived from three snails of the BB02 strain (shell diameter 8, 10 and 12 mm, respectively), established at the University of New Mexico, USA from a field isolate collected from Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2002. Using a genome size estimate of 0.9-1 Gb, we sequenced fragments (450 bp read length; 14.08 x coverage) and paired ends from 3 kb long inserts (8.12 x ) and 8 kb long inserts (2.82 x ) with reads generated on Roche 454 instrumentation, plus 0.06 x from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) ends on the ABI3730xl. Reads were assembled using Newbler (v2.6). Paired end reads from a 300 bp insert library (53.42 x coverage) were collected using Illumina instrumentation and assembled de novo using SOAP (v1.0.5). The Newbler assembly was merged with the SOAP assembly using GAA (see Supplementary Data 1 for accession numbers of sequence data sets). Redundant contigs in the merged assembly were collapsed and gaps between contigs were closed through iterative rounds of Illumina mate-pair read alignment and extension using custom scripts. We removed from the assembly all contaminating sequences, trimmed vectors (X), and ambiguous bases (N). Short contigs (&#8804 200 bp) were removed prior to public release. In the creation of the linkage group AGP files, we identified all scaffolds (145 Mb total) that were uniquely placed in a single linkage group (Supplementary Note 2; Supplementary Data 2). Note that because of low marker density, scaffolds could not be ordered or oriented within linkage groups.</p>

  From publication [1]: Computational annotation using Maker2 yielded 14,423 predicted gene models, including 96.5% of the 458 sequences from the CEGMA core set of eukaryotic genes. Total RNA was extracted from 12 different tissues/organs dissected from several individual adult BB02 <i>B. glabrata</i> snails (shell diameter 10-12 mm; between 2 and 10 snails per sample to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA). RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming, no size selection was done. Illumina RNAseq (paired ends) was used to generate tissue-specific transcriptomes for albumen gland (AG); buccal mass (BUC); central nervous system (CNS); digestive gland/hepatopancreas (DG/HP); muscular part of the headfoot (FOOT); heart including amebocyte producing organ (HAPO); kidney (KID); mantle edge (MAN); ovotestis (OVO); salivary gland (SAL); stomach (STO); terminal genitalia (TRG), see Supplementary Data 1 for accession numbers of sequence data sets. RNAseq data were mapped to the genome assembly (Supplementary Note 3). No formal effort was made to use the RNA-data to systematically enhance the structural annotation. VectorBase did, however, make this RNAseq data available in WebApollo such that the community could use these data to correct exon-intron junctions, UTRs, etc. through community annotation. All of these community-based updates have been incorporated and are available via the current VectorBase gene set. Repeat features were analyzed and masked (Supplementary Note 32; see Vectorbase Biomphalaria-glabrata-BB02_REPEATS.lib, Biomphalaria-glabrata-BB02_REPEATFEATURES_BglaB1.gff3.gz).</p>
