  <p>From Wikipedia: <i>Corbicula fluminea</i> is a species of freshwater clam, an aquatic bivalve mollusc in the family Cyrenidae. The species is regarded as having originated somewhere in Eastern Asia, leading to the common names of Asian clam or Asiatic clam. The species has been introduced into many parts of the world, including South America, North America and Europe. The primary economic and social impact of the invasion of <i>C. fluminea</i> has been billions of dollars in costs associated with clogged water intake pipes of power plants, among others. Ecologically, <i>C. fluminea</i> contributes to declines and replacement of highly vulnerable, already threatened native clams.</p>

  <p>Genome assembly imported from NCBI.</p>
  <p>From publication [1]: Total DNA was first isolated from one individual by a standard phenol-chloroform extraction protocol. Massive sequencing of one individual was performed in a 454 GS FLX device (Hoffmann-La Roche. Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in 1/8 of a plate. Reads were assembled using the specific 454-software GS DE NOVO ASSEMBLER (Newbler version 2.5.3; Roche 454 Life Sciences, Branford, Connecticut, USA), using the "Large or Complex Genome" and "Heterozygotic Mode" options.</p>
