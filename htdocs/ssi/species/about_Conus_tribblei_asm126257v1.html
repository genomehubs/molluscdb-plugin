  <p>From Wikipedia: <i>Conus tribblei</i> is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Conidae. Like all species within the genus Conus, these snails are predatory and venomous. This marine species occurs off Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, the Solomon Islands and Australia (Western Australia).</p>

  <p>From publication [1]: Several specimens of <i>C. tribblei</i> were collected using tangle nets from the depth of 96-136 m in Sogod, Cebu province in the Philippines. The whole body tissue of each specimen was stored in 95 % ethanol and kept at room temperature. DNA was extracted from the foot tissue of specimen <i>C. tribblei</i>_0317_1 (hereafter referred to as trib1) using DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, USA) according to manufacturer's recommendations and stored at -20 &#8451. A total of 32 &#956g DNA was used for construction of three libraries with different insert sizes: 170, 500 and 800 bp. Each library was sequenced on one lane of Illumina HiSeq 2000. The venom duct transcriptome of trib1 has been investigated recently (Barghi et al. 2015b).</p>
  <p>The quality of 100-bp long paired-end (PE) reads generated from three lanes of Illumina sequencing was evaluated using FastQC software v0.10.1 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Low quality bases (<20 phred score) at 3' and 5' ends of the reads were trimmed, and the low quality reads (reads in which less than 90 % of bases had phred score &#8805 20) were removed using FASTX-Toolkit version 0.0.6 (Pearson et al. 1997). Finally, the reads with no pairs were excluded using an in-house Python script. The Illumina reads were then corrected using the read correction package SOAPec_v2.01 (Luo et al. 2012). The corrected reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo2 (Luo et al. 2012) and ABySS -1.3.7 (Simpson et al. 2009). Assemblies with different k-mers of 25-65 were performed.</p>
