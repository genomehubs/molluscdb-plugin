  From Ensembl: <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>, the Pacific oyster, is native to Asia,
  but has been introduced around the world, intentionally for aquaculture, and
  accidentally such that it is sometimes viewed as an invasive species. Oysters
  are sessile bivalve molluscs, and <i>C. gigas</i> is a large estuarine species
  that thrives in a wide range of environmental conditions, helping to make it
  the most commercially important oyster species in the world. The Pacific
  oyster has many characteristics that are representative of molluscs and, more
  generally, lophotrochozoans, and its genome provides insight into metazoan
  evolution, in addition to being a valuable resource for studies of aquaculture
  [1].

<p>Genome assembly imported from Ensembl.</p>
<p>
  From Ensembl: The <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> genome was assembled in a
  hierarchical manner with a combination of fosmid pooling and whole-genome
  shotgun sequencing. The assembly consists of 7,658 scaffolds, with a genome
  size of approximately 558 Mb. The assembly is derived from INSDC records, and
  excludes ~4000 very short scaffolds from the
  <a href="http://gigadb.org/dataset/100030">original assembly data</a>.

<p>Gene models imported from Ensembl.</p>
<p>
  From Ensembl: The protein-coding genes are imported from the set of
  <a href="http://gigadb.org/dataset/100030">GigaDB</a> genes that were accepted
  as INSDC records (1928 genes were rejected when submitted to INSDC), plus 2
  additional genes in INDSC that are not in GigaDB. Non-coding RNA genes were
  added using the
  <a href="http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/ncrna"
    >Ensembl Genomes pipeline</a
  >, and BLAST hits and protein features have been computed.
