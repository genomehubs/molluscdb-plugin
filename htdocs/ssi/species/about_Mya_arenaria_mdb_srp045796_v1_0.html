  <p>The squinting bush brown butterfly, <em>Bicyclus anynana</em>, is a member of the remarkably speciose Mycalesine butterflies that are distributed across the Old World tropics [1]. Males have a wingspan of about 35-40 mm, while females are slightly larger (45-49 mm) [2]. Adults are found primarily in woodland habitats across East Africa (from southern Sudan in the north to Swaziland in the south), and are typically observed flying close to the ground where they feed on fallen fruit [2]. The larvae of <em>B. anynana</em> feed on several species of grass. It is a model organism for the study of the development, plasticity and evolution of butterfly wing patterns [2,3,4]. In addition, <em>B. anynana</em> is one of the only insect species to exhibit seasonal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphenism">polyphenism</a>, whereby individuals that develop during the wet season differ in both behaviour and appearance to those that develop during the dry season [1,5]. Wet-season butterflies are smaller, have shorter lifespans, are more active, and show large and conspicuous eyespots on their wings in comparison to dry season individuals [6]. Thus, <em>B. anynana</em> is an important system through which to study the evolution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity">phenotypic plasticity</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="assembly" style="margin-bottom:5px">Assembly</h2>
	<p>The sequencing of the <em>B. anynana</em> genome was performed jointly by <a href="http://www.genomics.ed.ac.uk">Edinburgh Genomics</a>, the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, and at the <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/genomic-research/">Centre for Genomic Research</a>, the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. The genome version 1.2 was assembled by Reuben Nowell using 140X 350bp insert Illumina paired-end (PE), 125X 550bp insert PE, 12X 3kbp insert Illumina mate-paired (MP), 20X 5kbp insert MP, 20X pacbio data. Briefly, (1) Using platanus: assemble PE only, scaffold with PE + MP libraries, gap-fill with PE only. (2) SCUBAT with Vicencio Oostra's evigene-filtered transcriptome. (3) Further scaffold with SSPACE-LongRead (PacBio data). (4) Further scaffold and gap-fill with PBJelly2 (PacBio data). (5) Further SCUBAT with all transcriptome data. (6) Further scaffold with SSPACE-LongRead again (since gap-filling may allow links that were not previously there). (7) GapFiller: Further gap-fill using PE data (since some gaps may be fillable between links that were not previously there).

  <h2 id="annotation" style="margin-bottom:5px">Annotation</h2>
  <p>The genome was repeat masked and a two pass annotation pipeline was used. In the first pass, MAKER was run using the 
following ab-inition gene finders: SNAP (HMM trained using CEGMA gene models) and GeneMark; and using a transcriptome assembly
to provide EST evidence. Full length MAKER gene models from this first pass were used to train an HMM for AUGUSTUS. A second pass
AUGUSTUS run resulted in the transcript predictions reported here. (Description thanks to Reuben Nowell)
