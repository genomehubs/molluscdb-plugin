  <p>From Wikipedia: The zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) is a small freshwater mussel (class Bivalvia). This species was originally native to the lakes of southern Russia and Ukraine, being first described in 1769 by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas in the Ural, Volga, and Dnieper rivers. However, the zebra mussel has been accidentally introduced to numerous other areas, and has become an invasive species in many different countries worldwide. Zebra mussels get their name from a striped pattern commonly seen on their shells, though it is not universally present. They are usually about the size of a fingernail, but can grow to a maximum length of nearly 2 in (5.1 cm). Shells are D-shaped, and attached to the substrate with strong byssal threads, which come out of their umbo on the dorsal (hinged) side.</p>

  <p>Genome assembly imported from NCBI.</p>
  <p>From publication [1]: DNA was sequenced using a 454 GS FLX platform using 1/8 of a plate. Reads were assembled using GS DE NOVO ASSEMBLER software, version 2.5.3. (Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Basel, Switzerland). Two strategies were used to compare different yield when recovering reads into the contigs. First, we used the default align and assemble parameters: minimum read length = 20 base pairs (bp); seed step = 12 bp; seed length = 16 bp; seed count = 1; minimum match length = 40 bp; overlap minimum match identity = 90%; alignment identity score = 2; alignment difference score = 3; and minimum output sequence size = 100 bp. Second, we ran an assembly to optimize the number of assembled reads into the contigs. We used the same assembled parameters and included the options of "Large or Complex Genome" to specify that the species was eukaryotic and "Heterozygotic Mode", due to the diploid nature of <i>D. polymorpha</i>.</p>
