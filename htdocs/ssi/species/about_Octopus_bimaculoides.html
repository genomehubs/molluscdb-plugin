  <p>From Ensembl: The California two-spot octopus (<i>Octopus bimaculoides</i>) is a member of the class Cephalopoda. Despite the first part of its name, has a range throughoput the eastern Pacific and the Indo-Pacific. The second part of its name derives from the false eye spot (ocellus) under each real eye, which is an iridescent blue chain-link circle set in a circle of black. It has several common colors, such as grey with yellow splotches, and uses highly developed crypsis (camouflage).</p>

  <p>From Ensembl: Version 2.2 of the gene set produced by the <a href="https://groups.oist.jp/molgenu/octopus-genome">OIST Molecular Genetics Unit</a>. Genes were annotated with the DOE Joint Genome Institute pipeline, which combines transcriptomic data with de novo and homology-based prediction methods [1]. Protein features and cross-references have been computed by Ensembl Metazoa.</p>
